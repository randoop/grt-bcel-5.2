    The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a
    convenient possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary)
    Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are
    represented by objects which contain all the symbolic information
    of the given class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in
    particular.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed
    by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. 
    An even more interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch 
    at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful 
    if you want to learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of 
    Java .class files. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BCEL contains a byte code verifier named JustIce, which usually
    gives you much better information about what's wrong with your
    code than the standard JVM message.
  </p>

  <p>
    BCEL is already being used successfully in several projects such
    as compilers, optimizers, obsfuscators, code generators
    and analysis tools. Unfortunately there hasn't been much development
    going on over the past few years. Feel free <a href="mail-lists.html">to help out</a> or you
    might want to have a look into the ASM project at objectweb.
